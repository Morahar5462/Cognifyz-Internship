# Data Science Internship - Cognifyz Technologies

## Where Data Meets Intelligence

### Overview
This repository contains my work during my **Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**. The tasks span multiple levels, covering **data exploration, preprocessing, geospatial analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization**. Each task was an opportunity to refine raw data into meaningful insights and build impactful models.

## 🚀 Tasks & Implementation

### **Level 1: Data Exploration and Descriptive Analysis**
#### 📌 Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explored the dataset and identified the number of **rows and columns**.
- Checked for **missing values** and handled them appropriately.
- Performed **data type conversions** where necessary.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (**Aggregate Rating**) and checked for **class imbalances**.

#### 📌 Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
- Calculated **statistical measures** (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explored the distribution of **categorical variables** like `Country Code`, `City`, and `Cuisines`.
- Identified the **top cuisines and cities** with the highest number of restaurants.

#### 📌 Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
- **Mapped** restaurant locations using **latitude and longitude**.
- Analyzed the **distribution** of restaurants across different cities and countries.
- Investigated the correlation between **restaurant location and ratings**.

### **Level 2: Business Insights & Pricing Analysis**
#### 📌 Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
- Determined the **percentage** of restaurants offering **table booking** and **online delivery**.
- Compared the **average ratings** of restaurants with and without table booking.
- Analyzed the **availability of online delivery** across different **price ranges**.

#### 📌 Task 2: Price Range Analysis
- Identified the **most common price range** among restaurants.
- Calculated the **average rating** for each price range.
- Determined the **color representation** associated with the highest-rated price range.

#### 📌 Task 3: Feature Engineering
- Extracted new features, such as **restaurant name length** and **address complexity**.
- Created new categorical features: **"Has Table Booking"** and **"Has Online Delivery"**.

---

### **Level 3: Advanced Analysis & Machine Learning**
#### 📌 Task 1: Predictive Modeling
- Built a **regression model** to predict the **aggregate rating** of a restaurant.
- Split the dataset into **training and testing sets**.
- Evaluated the model’s performance using appropriate **metrics**.
- Experimented with different **machine learning algorithms** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) and compared their **performance**.

#### 📌 Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis
- Analyzed the relationship between **cuisine type** and **restaurant ratings**.
- Identified the most **popular cuisines** based on customer votes.
- Determined cuisines that consistently receive **higher ratings**.

#### 📌 Task 3: Data Visualization
- Created visualizations to represent the **distribution of ratings** using histograms, bar plots, etc.
- Compared the **average ratings** of different **cuisines** and **cities**.
- Explored the **relationship between various features** and the target variable through **data visualization**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Folium)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration and visualization
- **Machine Learning Models** (Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
